  abstract = {A classic result of Johnson and Lindenstrauss asserts that any set
	of n points in d -dimensional Euclidean space can be embedded into
	k -dimensional Euclidean space where k is logarithmic in n and independent
	of d so that all pairwise distances are maintained within an arbitrarily
	small factor. All known constructions of such embeddings involve
	projecting the n points onto a random k -dimensional hyperplane.
	We give a novel construction of the embedding, suitable for database
	applications, which amounts to computing a simple aggregate over
	k random attribute partitions.},

	Signals, which was created under the auspices of the National Center
	for Research Resources of the National Institutes of Health, is intended
	to stimulate current research and new investigations in the study
	of cardiovascular and other complex biomedical signals. The resource
	has 3 interdependent components. PhysioBank is a large and growing
	archive of well-characterized digital recordings of physiological
	signals and related data for use by the biomedical research community.
	It currently includes databases of multiparameter cardiopulmonary,
	neural, and other biomedical signals from healthy subjects and from
	patients with a variety of conditions with major public health implications,
	including life-threatening arrhythmias, congestive heart failure,
	sleep apnea, neurological disorders, and aging. PhysioToolkit is
	a library of open-source software for physiological signal processing
	and analysis, the detection of physiologically significant events
	using both classic techniques and novel methods based on statistical
	physics and nonlinear dynamics, the interactive display and characterization
	of signals, the creation of new databases, the simulation of physiological
	and other signals, the quantitative evaluation and comparison of
	analysis methods, and the analysis of nonstationary processes. PhysioNet
	is an on-line forum for the dissemination and exchange of recorded
	biomedical signals and open-source software for analyzing them. It
	provides facilities for the cooperative analysis of data and the
	evaluation of proposed new algorithms. In addition to providing free
	electronic access to PhysioBank data and PhysioToolkit software via
	the World Wide Web (http://www.physionet.org), PhysioNet offers services
	and training via on-line tutorials to assist users with varying levels

  abstract = {Mallat's book is the undisputed reference in this field - it is the
	only one that covers the essential material in such breadth and depth.
	- Laurent Demanet, Stanford University The new edition of this classic
	book gives all the major concepts, techniques and applications of
	sparse representation, reflecting the key role the subject plays
	in today's signal processing. The book clearly presents the standard
	representations with Fourier, wavelet and time-frequency transforms,
	and the construction of orthogonal bases with fast algorithms. The
	central concept of sparsity is explained and applied to signal compression,
	noise reduction, and inverse problems, while coverage is given to
	sparse representations in redundant dictionaries, super-resolution
	and compressive sensing Balances presentation of the mathematics
	with applications to signal processing Algorithms and numerical examples
	are implemented in WaveLab, a MATLAB toolbox Companion website for
	instructors and selected solutions and code available for students

	image processing with curvelets and bandlets Wavelets for computer
	graphics with lifting on surfaces Time-frequency audio processing
	and denoising Image compression with JPEG-2000 New and updated exercises
	A Wavelet Tour of Signal Processing: The Sparse Way, third edition,
	is an invaluable resource for researchers and R\&D engineers wishing
	to apply the theory in fields such as image processing, video processing
	and compression, bio-sensing, medical imaging, machine vision and
	communications engineering. Stephane Mallat is Professor in Applied
	Mathematics at cole Polytechnique, Paris, France. From 1986 to 1996
	he was a Professor at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences
	at New York University, and between 2001 and 2007, he co-founded
	and became CEO of an image processing semiconductor company. Includes
	all the latest developments since the book was published in 1999,
	including its application to JPEG 2000 and MPEG-4 Algorithms and

	its similarity to the synthesis alternative, is markedly different.
	Surprisingly, the analysis model did not get a similar attention,
	and its understanding today is shallow and partial. In this paper
	we take a closer look at the analysis approach, better define it
	as a generative model for signals, and contrast it with the synthesis
	one. This work proposes effective pursuit methods that aim to solve
	inverse problems regularized with the analysis-model prior, accompanied
	by a preliminary theoretical study of their performance. We demonstrate
	the effectiveness of the analysis model in several experiments.},

	It is likely to be extremely efficient for practical problems because

  abstract = {:Compressive sensing (CS) is mainly concerned with low-coherence pairs,
	since the number of samples needed to recover the signal is proportional
	to the mutual coherence between projection matrix and sparsifying
	matrix. Until now, papers on CS always assume the projection matrix
	to be a random matrix. In this paper, aiming at minimizing the mutual
	coherence, a method is proposed to optimize the projection matrix.
	This method is based on equiangular tight frame (ETF) design because
	an ETF has minimum coherence. It is impossible to solve the problem
	exactly because of the complexity. Therefore, an alternating minimization
	type method is used to find a feasible solution. The optimally designed
	projection matrix can further reduce the necessary number of samples
	for recovery or improve the recovery accuracy. The proposed method
	demonstrates better performance than conventional optimization methods,
	which brings benefits to both basis pursuit and orthogonal matching
	pursuit.},
